#               Basic Compression Algo
A super simple basic "compression algorithm" to show during Supplemental Instruction sessions. Takes input in two forms, a "compressed" txt file in the format 'numberletter', e.g. 4A7B, or an "uncompressed" txt file in the format of 'letterletterletternextletternextletternextletternextletter', e.g. AAAABBBBBBB.

The program takes one of the two files at a time, and can convert back and forth between them.
